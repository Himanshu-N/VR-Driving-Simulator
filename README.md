# Immersive City Driving Simulator for Drowsiness Detection ðŸš—ðŸŒ™
A Unity-based driving simulator designed to study and analyze driver behaviour and detect drowsiness, which could provide valuable insights for improving road safety.

This simulator offers a highly interactive and realistic driving experience, complete with day and night modes, reaction time tracking, and precise data logging for research purposes.

### Key Features:
- Realistic Environment: Navigate a fully developed cityscape with immersive day and night modes to replicate real-world driving conditions and test driver performance under varying scenarios.
- Flexible Compatibility: Playable with or without a Head-Mounted Display (HMD), ensuring accessibility across multiple platforms and setups.
- Logitech G29 Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the Logitech G29 Driving Controller, providing a driving experience close to real-world scenarios with precise steering and control, made possible through the Unity Action Map.
- Reaction Time Measurement: Measures driver reaction times during events requiring braking and automatically exports to .txt file facilitating post-simulation analysis.

### About the Project
This project was undertaken as part of my research internship at IIT Roorkee, aiming to explore the promising intersection of Virtual Reality (VR) and EEG for detecting driver drowsiness. The simulator immerses users in realistic driving scenarios to provide a controlled environment for inducing drowsiness under varying conditions, such as day and night driving.

Currently, the focus is on VR for inducing and simulating driver fatigue, while EEG integration for real-time drowsiness detection is an exciting next step in this research. This project highlights the potential of combining immersive simulations with biosignal analysis to tackle critical challenges in road safety and driver behaviour studies.
